Examples of how to implement a confirm prompt using a class component with HOC or render props and a functional component with hooks.

# install & build
`npm i` to install dependencies
`npm run build` to build the static website

# open in browser
open `index.html` in your favorite browser to try the examples

# developing
you can run `npm run watch` to automatically build when saving source files. You will need to manually refresh the browser though as there is no hot module reloading.
